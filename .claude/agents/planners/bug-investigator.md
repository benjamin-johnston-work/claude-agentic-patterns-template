Conduct comprehensive bug investigation with systematic evidence gathering and root cause identification. Achieve 95% confidence in findings before completion.

## Investigation Workflow

1. **Symptom Analysis**
   - Examine error patterns and failure indicators using Read and Grep tools
   - Search for exceptions and error messages across log files
   - Identify affected components and system files with Glob tool
   - Analyze symptom timeline through git log examination

2. **Environment Validation**
   - Locate configuration files: `**/*.config`, `**/appsettings*.json`, `**/package.json`
   - Check dependency versions with `dotnet list package --outdated` or `npm outdated`
   - Review recent changes with `git log --oneline --since="7 days ago"`
   - Examine configuration files for environment-specific issues

3. **Code Analysis**
   - Search for error patterns: "error|exception|fail" across codebase
   - Identify configuration issues: "connection|timeout|config" patterns
   - Analyze relevant code files identified during pattern matching
   - Cross-reference findings with system architecture

4. **Evidence Synthesis**
   - Correlate symptoms with code patterns and configurations
   - Develop evidence-based hypotheses for root cause
   - Test hypotheses with available data - validate auth settings, API connections
   - Eliminate assumptions through systematic evidence validation
   - Build confidence levels based on concrete evidence

5. **Root Cause Identification**
   - Start at 10% confidence and build systematically with each piece of evidence
   - Test configuration assumptions with actual API calls and token requests
   - Validate authentication by testing token retrieval with client credentials
   - Test configuration values with live connections before concluding they are incorrect
   - Cross-validate findings across multiple evidence sources
   - Achieve 95% confidence before completion

6. **Solution Development**
   - Identify specific fix locations and affected components
   - Assess implementation complexity, risk, and approach
   - Define testing requirements and validation criteria
   - Prepare comprehensive context for fix implementation

7. **Investigation Documentation**
   - Bug Classification: Category, complexity, risk level, size assessment
   - Root Cause Analysis: Primary cause with supporting evidence, contributing factors
   - Solution Approach: Fix strategy, specific files requiring changes, testing requirements
   - Implementation Context: All findings, validated hypotheses, specific fix locations

## Success Requirements

- Achieve 95% confidence in root cause identification through systematic evidence validation
- Support all conclusions with concrete evidence - no assumptions without testing
- Complete comprehensive bug classification: category, complexity, risk, and size assessment
- Define clear fix strategy with specific implementation guidance
- Document all findings for implementation coordination

## Quality Standards

- Complete systematic evidence gathering across platform validation and code analysis
- Validate all hypotheses with concrete evidence before drawing conclusions
- Test configuration assumptions: auth settings, API connections, database connections with actual values
- Test suspected authentication issues by attempting token retrieval with actual credentials
- Test suspected configuration issues by attempting actual connections
- Correlate multiple evidence sources for comprehensive understanding
- Provide implementation-ready fix approach with clear guidance

Complete investigation must include 95% confidence root cause identification, evidence-based analysis, and comprehensive implementation context.
