- Analyze resource utilization patterns and identify optimization opportunities
- Assess auto-scaling capabilities and cloud resource efficiency in Azure environments
- Review performance monitoring and alerting systems for proactive issue identification

### Comprehensive Performance Optimization
- Backend API performance analysis with response time and throughput optimization
- Frontend performance assessment including load times, rendering efficiency, and user interaction responsiveness
- Database performance tuning with query optimization and indexing strategies
- Infrastructure performance evaluation including network, storage, and compute resource efficiency

## Performance Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Performance Baseline and Metrics Discovery

**Current Performance Assessment:**
- Analyze existing performance metrics, monitoring dashboards, and application telemetry
- Identify current response times, throughput, and resource utilization baselines
- Review performance testing results and load testing reports if available
- Assess user experience metrics including page load times and interaction responsiveness

**Performance Monitoring Infrastructure:**
- Evaluate current monitoring tools, APM solutions, and performance tracking systems
- Assess log aggregation and performance data collection capabilities
- Review alerting systems for performance degradation detection
- Analyze historical performance trends and incident patterns

**Business Impact Analysis:**
- Correlate performance issues with business metrics (conversion rates, user engagement, revenue)
- Identify performance-sensitive user workflows and critical business processes
- Assess performance requirements for different user segments and geographic regions
- Quantify potential business impact of performance improvements

### Phase 2: Backend Performance Analysis

**API and Service Performance:**
- Analyze API response times, endpoint performance, and service-to-service communication efficiency
- Identify slow database queries, inefficient algorithms, and resource-intensive operations
- Assess async/await patterns, parallel processing, and concurrency optimization opportunities
- Review caching strategies (Redis, in-memory caching, CDN utilization) and cache hit rates

**Database Performance Optimization:**
- Analyze query performance, execution plans, and database indexing strategies
- Identify N+1 query problems, missing indexes, and inefficient JOIN operations
- Assess Entity Framework query patterns and ORM optimization opportunities
- Review database connection pooling, transaction management, and deadlock prevention

**Infrastructure and Resource Utilization:**
- Analyze CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network utilization patterns
- Assess Azure service performance including App Service, SQL Database, and storage accounts
- Review auto-scaling configuration and resource allocation efficiency
- Identify infrastructure bottlenecks and capacity planning requirements

### Phase 3: Frontend Performance Analysis

**Client-Side Performance Assessment:**
- Analyze JavaScript bundle sizes, code splitting, and lazy loading implementations
- Assess CSS optimization, image compression, and asset delivery efficiency
- Review browser rendering performance and client-side resource utilization
- Evaluate Progressive Web App features and offline functionality performance

**Network and Load Time Optimization:**

- Assess CDN utilization, asset caching strategies, and compression techniques
- Review API call efficiency, data fetching patterns, and state management performance
- Evaluate mobile performance and responsive design efficiency

**User Experience Performance Metrics:**
- Analyze Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and user experience performance indicators
- Assess perceived performance, loading states, and user interaction responsiveness
- Review accessibility performance and assistive technology compatibility
- Evaluate cross-browser and cross-device performance consistency

### Phase 4: Scalability and Optimization Strategy

**Scalability Architecture Assessment:**
- Evaluate current architecture's horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities
- Analyze microservices performance, service mesh efficiency, and inter-service communication
- Assess data partitioning, sharding strategies, and distributed system performance

## Performance Analysis Validation

Execute during performance assessment:

```bash
# Build performance analysis
dotnet build --verbosity normal --no-restore | grep -E "Time Elapsed|Warning|Error"

# Bundle size and frontend performance (if applicable)
npm run build --prod 2>/dev/null || echo "No frontend build process detected"
find dist/ public/ wwwroot/ -name "*.js" -o -name "*.css" 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -lh | head -10

# Database query analysis (if accessible)
dotnet ef migrations list 2>/dev/null || echo "No Entity Framework migrations found"

# Memory and resource analysis
ps aux | head -20 2>/dev/null || echo "Process analysis not available in current environment"

# Network and API performance simulation
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -s -o /dev/null http://localhost:5000/health 2>/dev/null || echo "Local API not accessible for performance testing"
```

**Output**: Comprehensive performance analysis report with quantified bottlenecks, business impact assessment, and prioritized optimization roadmap with concrete implementation strategies.
