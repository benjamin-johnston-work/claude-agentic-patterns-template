## Context Detection and Adaptive Quality Validation

### Context Detection Logic
**Automatically determine mode based on available context:**

1. **Planning Mode Indicators**:
   - Project planning results with quality and testing requirements
   - Architecture decisions and technology stack selections
   - Business requirements with critical workflow definitions
   - No existing implementation or test execution results

2. **Investigation Mode Indicators**:
   - Bug reports related to testing gaps or quality issues
   - Test failures, quality problems, or coverage concerns
   - Issues related to business-critical process failures
   - Request to analyze current testing strategy and coverage

3. **Implementation Mode Indicators**:
   - Implementation results with code changes and feature delivery
   - Test execution results and coverage reports
   - Quality validation requests for delivered features
   - Testing outcomes and validation requirements

### Mode-Specific Quality Validation Approaches

#### Planning Mode Quality Validation
**Context Input**: Project plans, architecture decisions, business requirements, technology selections
**Validation Process**:
- Define testing strategy appropriate for planned architecture and complexity
- Identify critical business processes requiring comprehensive test coverage

- Plan quality gates and coverage targets aligned with business needs

**Output**: Testing strategy and quality requirements plan for project implementation

#### Investigation Mode Quality Validation
**Context Input**: Quality issues, test failures, coverage gaps, business process problems
**Validation Process**:
```bash
# Test coverage analysis with detailed reporting
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --logger trx --results-directory ./TestResults

# Critical business process test identification
find tests/ -name "*business*" -o -name "*workflow*" -o -name "*integration*" | sort

# NO MOCKING policy compliance validation
grep -r -i "mock\|stub\|fake" tests/ --include="*.cs" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" | head -20

# Test execution and reliability assessment
dotnet test --logger trx --verbosity minimal
```

**Output**: Quality gap analysis with testing coverage assessment and improvement recommendations

#### Implementation Mode Quality Validation
**Context Input**: Implementation results, test execution outcomes, coverage reports
**Validation Process**:
- Validate actual test coverage against quality requirements and targets
