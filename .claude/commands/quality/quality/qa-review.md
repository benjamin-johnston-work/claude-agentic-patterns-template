Perform QA review: $ARGUMENTS

## Primary Goals

Execute comprehensive testing strategy validation through master-coordinated specialist analysis, ensuring 80%+ coverage targets, business-critical process validation, and enterprise testing policy compliance.

## Agent Coordination

**MASTER COORDINATOR**: @qa-validator orchestrates all testing specialists

**SEQUENTIAL COORDINATION** - @qa-validator coordinates in this order:

1. **@test-coverage-analyst**: Coverage analysis and metrics validation
   - Quantify unit test coverage with 80% target assessment
   - Analyze critical business process coverage gaps
   - Validate test isolation and reliability standards
   - Generate coverage reports with actionable improvement plans

2. **@integration-test-specialist**: Integration testing strategy assessment
   - Evaluate integration test coverage for critical business processes
   - Validate real dependency testing (NO MOCKING policy enforcement)
   - Assess external service integration point testing quality
   - Review database and API integration test completeness

3. **@e2e-test-specialist**: End-to-end testing validation
   - Validate essential user workflow coverage
   - Assess revenue-generating path testing completeness
   - Review browser testing implementation and framework appropriateness
   - Evaluate regulatory and compliance process testing coverage

4. **@test-reliability-specialist**: Test maintenance and reliability assessment
   - Analyze test framework appropriateness and configuration
   - Assess test reliability, flakiness, and maintainability
   - Evaluate CI/CD pipeline integration and performance impact
   - Review test data management and environment consistency

**FINAL COORDINATION**: @qa-validator consolidates all specialist findings into comprehensive validation report

## Success Criteria

**Confidence Gates:**
- Master coordinator achieves 95% confidence in overall testing strategy assessment
- Coverage analyst confirms 80%+ unit test coverage or documents specific gaps
- Integration specialist validates NO MOCKING policy compliance at 100%
- E2E specialist confirms all revenue-generating workflows are covered
- Reliability specialist confirms <5% test flakiness rate

**Validation Requirements:**
- Business-critical processes have complete test coverage validation
- Real dependency testing enforced across all integration points
- Browser testing strategy matches application complexity appropriately
- Performance impact on CI/CD pipeline stays under acceptable thresholds
- Test approach appropriately matches application architecture and scale

**Output Standards:**
- Comprehensive QA validation report with testing strategy assessment
