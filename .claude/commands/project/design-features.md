# Project Feature Design

I'll coordinate feature design specialists to create implementation-ready specifications for all features in the project catalog using confidence-gated batch processing: $ARGUMENTS

## Feature Design Workflow

I'll execute efficient batch processing with confidence gates and TodoWrite tracking for comprehensive feature design coverage.

## Process

**Step 1: Feature Catalog Extraction and Planning**
- Load project overview document from project directory
- Extract complete feature catalog with business and technical features
- Create TodoWrite with all features to be designed for progress tracking
- Identify feature dependencies and batch processing sequence

**Step 2: Confidence-Gated Batch Processing**

For each batch of 3-5 features from the extracted catalog:

> Use the feature-planner agent to plan the current feature batch achieving 7-10/10 confidence for each feature in the batch based on project context, architecture decisions, and feature requirements

> Use the architecture-validator agent to validate the planned feature batch for architecture integration, DDD context mapping, and enterprise pattern compliance with validation confidence gates

> Use the feature-documentor agent to create individual implementation-ready FEAT-YYYY-MMDD-{feature-name}.md specifications for each validated feature in the batch, including technical requirements, architecture integration, and development guidance

**After each batch:**
- Update TodoWrite marking completed features
- Validate batch consistency and integration requirements
- Prepare next feature batch for processing

**Step 3: Feature Design Integration and Roadmap**
- Validate feature dependencies and integration requirements across all batches
- Ensure consistent architecture approach across all features  
- Create feature implementation roadmap with dependencies
- Prepare all features for implementation phase workflows

## Expected Output

**Feature Specifications Created:**
- `docs/projects/PROJECT-NAME/features/FEAT-YYYY-MMDD-{feature-1}.md`
- `docs/projects/PROJECT-NAME/features/FEAT-YYYY-MMDD-{feature-2}.md`
- `docs/projects/PROJECT-NAME/features/FEAT-YYYY-MMDD-{feature-N}.md`

**Each Feature Specification Contains:**
- Complete business and technical requirements
- Architecture integration with Onion Architecture layers
- DDD bounded context definitions and domain relationships
- Implementation sequence and development guidance
- Testing strategy and quality gate requirements
- Integration requirements and dependency specifications

## Success Criteria

**Batch Processing Efficiency:**
- All features from project catalog processed in manageable 3-5 feature batches
- TodoWrite tracking shows progress across all features with completion status
- Confidence gates achieved (7-10/10 planning, validation confidence) for each feature
- Resource management prevents memory exhaustion through batch processing

**Feature Quality Standards:**
- All features from project catalog have implementation-ready specifications
- Feature architecture validated for enterprise compliance and consistency
- Feature dependencies and integration requirements clearly documented across batches
- Each individual FEAT-YYYY-MMDD-{feature-name}.md enables direct implementation workflow execution
- Features ready for `/development/features/implement-feature` commands

**Agent Coordination:**
- Each agent operates in isolated context per batch (no shared state)
- Only feature-documentor creates actual files (planner and validator provide analysis only)
- Batch consistency validated between processing cycles
- Feature integration requirements preserved across batch boundaries

This creates a complete bridge from high-level project planning to detailed feature implementation, ensuring every feature has the detailed specifications needed for successful development while maintaining efficiency and resource management.
