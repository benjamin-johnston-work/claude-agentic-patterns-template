# Complete MVP-to-Enterprise Project Planning

I'll coordinate specialist agents sequentially to create a complete project evolution plan from MVP delivery to enterprise-ready end state for: $ARGUMENTS

## Planning Philosophy

**Smart Evolution Planning**:
- Plan database schema and architecture to avoid refactoring as you scale. You may not implement this in MVP but should be planned upfront.
- Design API contracts that can evolve backward-compatibly
- Choose technology stack that grows from MVP to enterprise without migrations

**MVP-First Implementation**:
- Implementation plan should be designed to build only features needed for validation in first iteration
- Each evolution phase adds business value incrementally
- Architecture supports growth but starts with minimal complexity
- For example do not include a database or persistant cache unless these are needed for the MVP. 

## Planning Approach

**Planning Scope**: Complete evolution path from MVP to enterprise
**Implementation Scope**: Start with MVP validation features only

Agents should plan the complete journey but specify:
- What to build in MVP (minimal features for validation)
- What to build in each iteration (incremental value)  
- How architecture supports this growth without refactoring

## Complete Evolution Planning Workflow

I'll execute the following sequence to plan the entire journey from MVP to enterprise scale:

1. **MVP-to-Enterprise Architecture Planning**: Use the architecture-planner agent to design the complete evolution path with database-first design, clean architecture from day one, and clear progression from MVP through transitional states to enterprise-ready end state
2. **Technology Stack Planning**: Use the tech-stack-planner agent to select technologies that support the entire evolution journey without requiring migrations or refactoring  
3. **Complete Evolution Validation**: Use the project-validator agent to validate the feasibility of the entire MVP-to-enterprise journey including 2-4 week MVP delivery and all evolution phases
4. **Enterprise Architecture Compliance**: Use the architecture-validator agent to validate that the complete evolution maintains enterprise standards throughout all phases
5. **Complete Project Documentation**: Use the project-documentor agent to document the entire evolution strategy with MVP delivery plan, iteration phases, and enterprise-ready end state

Each agent plans for the COMPLETE journey, not just MVP - ensuring clean evolution without refactoring or migrations.

## Process

Let me start by analyzing your project requirements and then sequentially coordinate with each specialist agent:

**Step 1: Complete Architecture Evolution Planning**
> Use the architecture-planner agent to design the complete MVP-to-enterprise evolution path including database-first design, clean architecture from day one, C4 evolution diagrams showing MVP → Transitional → End State progression, and enterprise patterns that avoid refactoring throughout the journey.

**Step 2: Evolution-Ready Technology Stack Planning** 
> Use the tech-stack-planner agent to select technologies that support the entire evolution journey from 2-4 week MVP delivery through enterprise scale without requiring technology migrations or architectural refactoring.

**Step 3: Complete Evolution Feasibility Validation**
> Use the project-validator agent to validate the feasibility of delivering working software in 2-4 weeks AND the complete evolution path to enterprise scale, ensuring realistic timelines and resource requirements for the entire journey.

**Step 4: Enterprise Architecture Compliance Throughout Evolution**
> Use the architecture-validator agent to validate that enterprise standards (Onion Architecture, DDD, Clean Architecture) are maintained throughout all evolution phases from MVP to enterprise scale.

**Step 5: Complete Evolution Documentation**
> Use the project-documentor agent to create comprehensive documentation covering the 2-4 week MVP delivery plan, all iteration phases with business value gates, and the complete roadmap to enterprise-ready end state.

Each specialist plans the COMPLETE evolution strategy - from immediate value delivery through enterprise scale - ensuring clean, iterative growth without technical debt or architectural refactoring.
