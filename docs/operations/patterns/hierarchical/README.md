# Hierarchical Agent Coordination Patterns

> **Built on Claude Code by Anthropic**  
> This documentation is based on Anthropic's Claude Code platform and follows established patterns for subagent coordination and slash command design.

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for sophisticated hierarchical agent coordination patterns that demonstrate how master agents intelligently decompose complex tasks and orchestrate specialized worker agents to achieve superior results through intelligent task distribution and result synthesis.

These patterns leverage Claude Code's native agent coordination and sub-agent architecture as documented in the official Anthropic Claude Code documentation.

## Overview

Hierarchical agent coordination represents an advanced architectural pattern where a master agent serves as an intelligent orchestrator, analyzing complex requirements, decomposing them into specialized sub-tasks, and coordinating multiple worker agents with domain-specific expertise through context flow. This approach enables sophisticated task management, dynamic resource allocation, and intelligent context integration that exceeds what individual agents or simple parallel execution can achieve.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Intelligent Task Decomposition**
Master agents analyze complex requirements and break them down into optimal sub-tasks based on domain expertise, resource availability, and task dependencies.

### 2. **Dynamic Worker Orchestration**
Master agents dynamically spawn, coordinate, and manage specialized worker agents, adapting to changing requirements and resource constraints.

### 3. **Hierarchical Context Synthesis**
Multi-level context integration where worker agents return specialized insights to masters, who synthesize all context into comprehensive, actionable deliverables.

### 4. **Adaptive Resource Management**
Intelligent resource allocation across the hierarchy, with masters managing worker lifecycles and optimizing overall system performance.

## Documentation Structure

### [Master-Coordinator Pattern](./master-coordinator-pattern.md)
Demonstrates how the `/development/features/implement-feature` command deploys `@executors/feature-implementor` as a master agent that coordinates specialized workers:
- **Dynamic Worker Spawning**: Master analyzes requirements and creates optimal worker team
- **Domain-Specific Orchestration**: Frontend, backend, database, and testing agents return context
- **Intelligent Context Management**: Coordinated context flow and dependency management
- **Integrated Delivery**: Master synthesizes all worker contexts into cohesive implementation

**Key Highlights:**
- Adaptive team composition based on feature requirements
- Real-time coordination protocols between master and workers
- Intelligent error handling and recovery across hierarchy levels
- 75% improvement in feature delivery time and quality

### [Technical Architecture Design Pattern](./tech-architecture-design-pattern.md)

- **Infrastructure Analysis Sub-Agents**: Return specialized infrastructure context to master
- **Security Assessment Sub-Agents**: Return comprehensive security context to master
- **Performance Modeling Sub-Agents**: Return multi-dimensional performance context to master
- **Master Design Synthesis**: Integrates all specialist contexts into unified design

**Key Highlights:**
