# Bug Investigation Parallel Pattern - Multiple Evidence Gathering

> **Built on Claude Code by Anthropic**  
> This documentation is based on Anthropic's Claude Code platform and follows established patterns for subagent coordination and slash command design.

## Pattern: Multiple Investigation Agents with Context Isolation

**Primary Goal**: Investigate complex bugs by gathering evidence from multiple specialist agents, each operating in isolated context windows for deep domain focus.

**Success Criteria**:
- Comprehensive evidence gathering through specialist domain expertise
- Each agent operates in isolated context window for focused analysis
- Evidence correlation through main conversation context flow
- Human validation of investigation findings before solution implementation

**Key Principle**: Agents operate in **isolated context windows**, not truly "parallel" - each has deep focus in their specialized domain without context interference.

## Coordination Strategy: Specialist Coordination with Context Isolation (Following Official Claude Code Patterns)

**Command Logic:**
```markdown
---
description: Investigate complex bug using specialized agents with context isolation
argument-hint: [bug description]
---

1. Coordinate specialized investigators using explicit invocation for: $ARGUMENTS
   - Use the `code-reviewer` agent to analyze code quality and potential issues
   - Use the `security-analyzer` agent to assess security vulnerabilities
   - Use the `performance-analyzer` agent to identify performance bottlenecks
   - Use the `architecture-validator` agent to review architecture compliance
2. Each agent investigates their domain in isolated context window
3. Results flow through main conversation for correlation and integration
4. Use @validators/documentor to synthesize findings and identify root cause
5. Present investigation report for human validation
```

**Why Context Isolation (Following Official Documentation):**
- **Deep Focus**: Each agent operates in isolated context for specialized analysis
- **No Context Pollution**: Main conversation maintains high-level investigation focus
- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent focuses on one clear domain expertise
- **Rich Context Flow**: Results integrate through main conversation for human evaluation

## Specialized Agent Responsibilities

### @validators/code-reviewer - Code Investigation (Isolated Context)
**Primary Focus**: Code quality analysis and potential issue identification in isolated context window
- Static code analysis for code quality and potential issues
- Code pattern analysis and best practice validation  
- Variable usage analysis and error handling validation
- Code structure analysis and maintainability assessment
- Method and function analysis for correctness and efficiency

**Single Responsibility**: Code quality assessment ONLY - operates in own context window without coordination abilities.

**Investigation Focus Areas**:
- Code quality patterns and anti-patterns
- Error handling and exception management
- Performance implications of code structure
- Security vulnerabilities in code implementation
- Architecture compliance at code level

### @validators/security-analyzer - Security Investigation (Isolated Context)
**Primary Focus**: Security vulnerability and threat analysis in isolated context window
- Security vulnerability identification and assessment
- Authentication and authorization issue analysis
- Data protection and encryption validation
- Input validation and injection attack detection
- Security pattern compliance and best practice validation

**Single Responsibility**: Security analysis ONLY - operates in own context window without coordination abilities.

**Investigation Focus Areas**:
- Authentication and authorization vulnerabilities
- Input validation and injection attack vectors
- Data exposure and encryption issues
- Security configuration and compliance gaps
- Access control and permission analysis

### @validators/performance-analyzer - Performance Investigation (Isolated Context)
**Primary Focus**: Performance bottleneck and optimization analysis in isolated context window
- Performance bottleneck identification and analysis
- Resource usage pattern analysis and optimization opportunities
- Query performance analysis and database optimization
- Memory usage analysis and leak detection
- Algorithm efficiency analysis and optimization recommendations

**Single Responsibility**: Performance analysis ONLY - operates in own context window without coordination abilities.

**Investigation Focus Areas**:
- Performance bottlenecks and resource constraints
- Query optimization and database performance

- Scalability and maintainability assessment

**Single Responsibility**: Architecture validation ONLY - operates in own context window without coordination abilities.

### @validators/documentor - Evidence Synthesis (Following Official Patterns)
**Primary Focus**: Synthesis of specialist findings through main conversation context flow
- Correlates findings from all specialist investigators through main conversation
- Identifies patterns and relationships across evidence sources
- Eliminates duplicate findings and resolves conflicts
- Generates root cause hypotheses with supporting evidence
- Creates comprehensive investigation report with recommendations

**Following Official Documentation**: Uses simple synthesis patterns, not complex orchestration code.

## Pattern Benefits (Following Official Claude Code Documentation)
