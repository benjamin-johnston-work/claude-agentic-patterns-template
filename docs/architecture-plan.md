  name: String!
  url: String!
  language: String!
  description: String
  branches: [Branch!]!
  documentation: Documentation
  insights: [Insight!]!
  lastAnalyzed: DateTime
}

type Documentation {
  id: ID!
  repository: Repository!
  sections: [Section!]!
  generatedAt: DateTime!
  version: String!
}

type Query {
  repositories(filter: RepositoryFilter): [Repository!]!
  repository(id: ID!): Repository
  searchRepositories(query: String!): [Repository!]!
  askRepository(repositoryId: ID!, query: String!): QueryResponse!
}

type Mutation {
  addRepository(input: AddRepositoryInput!): Repository!
  refreshRepository(id: ID!): Repository!
  submitQuery(repositoryId: ID!, query: String!): QueryResponse!
}
